Alembic Command Cheat Sheet


(with a new project) To create migrations from scratch:
alembic init migrations
- change alembic.ini (line 63) to have correct DB
- change env.py to have target_metadata = Base.metadata imported from Models

When upgrading the model with changes made:

alembic revision --autogenerate -m
alembic upgrade head

ipdb code for Pet-owner:
